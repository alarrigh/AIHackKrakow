# Introduction 

In this course, you learn how to create an end-to-end data science solution, applying advanced machine learning (ML) approaches to a real-world scenario, variants of which can be found across industry verticals. This hands-on training covers various important machine learning algorithms. Use notebooks to understand the math behind data science and learn best practices for cleansing and manipulating your data to gather insights from it. Then, build an ML model on this data using techniques that will give you a foray into a data scientistâ€™s work. Further, see MLOps (DevOps for ML) in action while learning how to productionize your models. Learn how to do the following: (1) perform data preparation and feature engineering with Pandas dataframes; (2) conduct model development with the Scikit-Learn ML library; (3) learn essentials of machine learning experimentation (model management and evaluation) with AML service; (4) perform tuning of hyperparameters with HyperDrive on AML Compute; (5) quickly find the best combination of ML algorithm and feature selection with automated machine learning; and (6) set up real-time scoring with Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
